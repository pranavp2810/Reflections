When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This makes the work available for the public or other people to work on
while always having a master on one's computer locally. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
 Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 This gives us complete control over what we want to commit locally 
 and what we want commited publicly.
